# JWT Authentication in ASP.NET Core API

## Introduction
JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is a method of securing APIs by using tokens encoded as JSON objects. This guide explains how to implement JWT authentication in your ASP.NET Core API.

## Prerequisites
- ASP.NET Core project set up
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET Core and JWT authentication

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the Required NuGet Packages
To enable JWT authentication in your ASP.NET Core project, you need to install the following NuGet package:
```
dotnet add package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
```

### Step 2: Configure JWT Authentication in the Startup Class
Open the `Startup.cs` file in your project and make the following modifications:

Add the necessary namespaces at the top of the file:

```
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.Text;
```
In the ConfigureServices method, add the following code to configure JWT authentication:

```
var appSettingsSection = Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings");
services.Configure<AppSettings>(appSettingsSection);

var appSettings = appSettingsSection.Get<AppSettings>();
var key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(appSettings.Key);

services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.SaveToken = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(key),
        ValidateIssuer = false,
        ValidateAudience = false
    };
});

```
üîç Retrieving Configuration Settings:

- we have to Retrieve the configuration section named "AppSettings" from the configuration file.
- after that we need to Bind the configuration section to the AppSettings class and then Retrieve the strongly-typed AppSettings object from the configuration.
- Next,Convert the JWT key to a byte array using ASCII encoding.
- Configuring Authentication Services:

üõ†Ô∏è Configure the authentication services in the application.
- First we need to Set the default authentication and challenge schemes to JWT Bearer authentication.
- Add the JWT Bearer authentication scheme and configure its options.
- Specify that the JWT token should be saved in the authentication properties.
- Set the token validation parameters for JWT validation.
‚úÖ Enable validation of the issuer signing key.
- Set the issuer signing key for JWT token signature validation.
‚ùå Disable validation of the issuer.
‚ùå Disable validation of the audience.
By following these steps, you can configure JWT authentication in your ASP.NET Core API.

### Step 3: Create the User Model
Create a new class file named User.cs and add the following code to define the User model:
```
namespace JWTtoken.Models
{
    public class User
    {
        public int UserId { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string UserName { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
        public string Role { get; set; }
        public string Token { get; set; }
    }
}
```
### Step 4: Create the Authentication Controller
Create a new controller file named AuthenticationController.cs and add the following code to define the authentication controller:

```
using JWTtoken.Models;
using JWTtoken.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace JWTtoken.Controllers
{
    [Route("[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class AuthenticationController : ControllerBase
    {
        private IAuthenticateService _authenticateService;

        public AuthenticationController(IAuthenticateService authenticateService)
        {
            _authenticateService = authenticateService;
        }

        // POST: /Authentication
        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Post([FromBody] User model)
        {
            // Call the Authenticate method of the injected service to validate the user credentials
            var user = _authenticateService.Authenticate(model.UserName, model.Password);

            // If the user is not found or the password is incorrect, return a BadRequest response
            if (user == null)
            {
                return BadRequest(new { message = "Username or Password is Incorrect" });
            }

            // If the user is successfully authenticated, return an Ok response with the user object
            return Ok(user);
        }
    }
}
```
- The AuthenticationController is responsible for handling authentication-related operations.
- It is a part of the JWTtoken project.
- The controller is defined with the route [controller], where [controller] is replaced with the actual name "Authentication".
- It is an API controller that inherits from ControllerBase.
- The controller has a constructor that injects an IAuthenticateService instance for user authentication.
- The Post action method handles the POST request for user authentication.
- It takes a User object containing the user credentials (username and password) as the request body.
- The Authenticate method of the injected service is called to validate the user credentials.
- If the user is not found or the password is incorrect, a BadRequest response is returned with an appropriate error message.
- If the user is successfully authenticated, an Ok response is returned with the user object, which includes the JWT token.
- The AuthenticationController is an essential component in the JWT token-based authentication flow.
- By following these steps, the AuthenticationController facilitates user authentication by verifying the credentials and returning the appropriate responses.

### Step 5: Update the ConfigureServices Method
In the ConfigureServices method of the Startup.cs file, add the following code to register the services:
```
services.AddScoped<IAuthenticateService, AuthenticateService>();
```
### Step 6: Protect API Endpoints with JWT Authentication

- Use the [Authorize(Roles = "User,Admin")] attribute on the Get action method to specify that only authenticated users with the roles "User" or "Admin" can access the endpoint:
```
[HttpGet]
[Authorize(Roles = "User,Admin")]
public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
{
  
}
```
- By adding the [Authorize(Roles = "User,Admin")] attribute to the Get action method, you ensure that only users with the roles "User" or "Admin" can access the endpoint.
-  Similarly, the [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] attribute on the GetForAdmin action method restricts access to users with the "Admin" role.
### Step 7: Configure AppSettings
- In the appsettings.json file, configure the AppSettings section with the JWT key:
```
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "Key": "YourJWTKeyHere"
  },
  ```
## Conclusion
By following these steps, We can implement JWT authentication in your ASP.NET Core API. JWT authentication provides a secure way to protect your API endpoints and restrict access to authorized users based on their roles.
